### Overview

The <b>docpad-skeleton-apidoc</b> repository is a simple documentation portal theme/template. It is based on a static site generator called [DocPad](https://docpad.org/). It is also, by default, configured to use [Chewie](https://github.com/YaaS/chewie), the module supporting distributed source publishing.

Go through this tutorial to:
- Set up your local environment to build a documentation portal
- Understand and configure your own distributed source publishing flow
- Publish the portal to GitHub Pages

You will use the following technologies:
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [GitHub](https://github.com) and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
- [DocPad](https://docpad.org/) and the documentation portal template based on it: [docpad-skeleton-apidoc](https://github.com/YaaS/docpad-skeleton-apidocs)
